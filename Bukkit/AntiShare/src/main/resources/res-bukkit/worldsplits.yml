# World splits are literal splits that span the world. A specified
# value on an axis becomes the dividing line between two gamemodes
# where crossing the line forces another gamemode. This is enforced
# on a per-world basis and ensures players on either side have the
# correct gamemode. Invalid world splits will be ignored with a
# warning printed to your console.
#
# A world split is simply defined in the list below as you can see
# in the example. If the example is not present, see the following
# commented portion.
#
# Example split:
# - world: MyWorldName
#   axis: X
#   value: 250
#   positive: creative
#   negative: survival
#
# The example world split simply says that at X=250, anybody on the
# positive side (251 -> infinity) will be in creative mode and  anyone
# on the negative side (249 -> -infinity) will be in survival mode.
worldsplits:
- world: MyWorldName
  axis: X
