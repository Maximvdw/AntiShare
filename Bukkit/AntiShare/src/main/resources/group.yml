# AntiShare Group Configuration
# -------------------------------------------------
# This is an AntiShare Group configuration file. Within this
# file you will find settings to control a certain group of
# settings, applying them to players. This permits the ability
# to have, for example, less restrictive donor ranks. However,
# these configurations still act shadowed in the background,
# meaning that blocks placed by one "group" will not be restricted
# by another. These group configurations are only for specifying
# settings for a selection of players.
#
# To not use group settings, simply edit the "group_main.yml" as
# this will only have one group and no others. All new groups must
# be named as "group_<NAME>.yml" where <NAME> must be unique. The
# filename is not used anywhere in-game and is for your reference
# only. The name listed below is the name of which the plugin uses.
# Only the group_main.yml file cannot be renamed, as this is the
# master group AntiShare uses.
#
# For more information, please see this document: <LINK PENDING>
#
#
# General group settings. These allow for basic setup of the group
# as well as some other minor things. Please note that editing these
# settings on the group_main.yml file have no effect unless otherwise
# specified.
#
# The group name. "none" and "main" are invalid group names as these
# are reserved for internal operation. Only group_main.yml may have the
# name "main".
name: main
# The permission node for the group. If a player has this permission,
# they will be affected by this configuration.
permission-enable: antishare.group.main
# The enabled flag. If true, this group is in effect. If false, this
# group is not being used. Groups which inherit this group will not
# ignore this flag and therefore will not inherit settings if disabled.
enabled: true
# Inheritance tree. Any groups listed below are to be listed from the "name"
# field above. If the group cannot be found, the entry is simply ignored. If
# the entry is disabled, the entry is also ignored. Specify "none" for no inheritance.
# The main configuration ignores this setting.
